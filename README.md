# Analysis of info on Miray International's Life at Sea Cruise
This is an analysis of the planned 2023-2026 Life at Sea Cruise
itinerary: time planned at each port,
time of each voyage, etc. This is an independent analysis, not associated with the operator
of the cruise (Miray International), meant to help participants understand the plan.
The itinerary is of course subject to change as explained at
[Life at Sea Cruise](https://www.lifeatseacruises.com/)

See the [PDF](life_at_sea_analyze.pdf) for the analysis.
